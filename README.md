# Guess-my-number-
The first project is called Guess My Number. The goal of this project is to simply guess a secret number which is between one and twenty. So in input we can type a number. Letâ€™s say 10, then we click Check. And then on the right side we get a message. It can be that our guess Too Low or Too High. Also we can see that we have a Score of 20 and after one failed guess it decreased to 19. So basically after each guess that we fail, the score decreases by one. When we get the correct number message. The screen turns green and then if you want to play again, we can simply click the Again button and it all resets everything except for the High score. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108603544/183348047-a0c8091c-3027-4d69-b9e0-192b84412095.png)
